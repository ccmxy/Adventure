# adventure
This is an adventure game written in C in which 7 rooms are randomly chosen from 10, 
and each of those 7 rooms is connected to somewhere between 3 and 6 other rooms. 
It is not possible to reach a dead end. 

#From terminal in a linux machine:
Simply type "adventure" to run the exectable file. You will be presented with a list of 
your current location and a list of rooms that are connected to it. Try to get to the final room,
which is different each time. 

If you want to make the executable file yourself, type

`gcc -o [what you want to call executable file] adventure.c`
